      Create a flexible grid with 1 row and 4 columns. The width of each column
      is 25% of the window size. This percentage width must be maintained even
      if the page is resized. Each cell of the grid can contain another 1x4
      flexible grid. The border of the grid must be 1px black. Perform the
      following operations based on the value of window size: If the window size
      is less than 960px, then the 1x4 flexible grid becomes a 2x2 grid. That
      is, the 3rd and 4th columns slide down onto the 2nd row. If the window
      size is less than 640px, then the 1x4 flexible grid becomes 4x1 grid. Each
      column slides under the one before it. The 2nd column slides under the
      1st, the 3rd slides under the 2nd, and the 4th slides under the 3rd. DO
      NOT USE BOOTSTRAP
